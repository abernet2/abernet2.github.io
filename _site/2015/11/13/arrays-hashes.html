					<p id="intro-blurb">All variables in programming are stored in blocks of memory. Computers might seem like magic most of the time, but they are manifested in physical space just like everything else. So let's breakdown how computers "magically" store arrays and hashes in their physical memory.</p>
					<h2>All about arrays</h2>
					<p>What does this have to do with arrays? When you declare an object in Ruby you're essentially telling the computer "I need an object's worth of memory."  When you declare an array of a certain size you tell the computer you need that much memory plus "I need the obejcts in this array to stay together."  Then the computer puts in extra work to make sure the array's variables stay together in memory.</p>
					<p> When you ask the computer for array[index], what the computer does with that information is it takes the starting point for the array and adds the necessary distance to get the object you want. So array[index] tells the computer, give me the thing at: <span class="code-block">memory address = [array starting address] + [index] * [size of objects in ruby]</span class="code"> This is why arrays are indexed at 0. It makes the math for accessing elements simpler since the first item is at the array starting index. If the array were 1-index, using this math it would always get the item 1 larger than what you wanted.
					</p>
					<h2>Hashes are a bit like arrays</h2>
					<p>Accessing information in a hash, for the user, is similar to an array, you just put a key in the variable instead of an index, like so: hash["key"]. If you wanted to access an array as you would a hash, you would have to search the contents of the array. For example, if I had a 100 x 2 array of first and last names and I wanted to find someone's name, if the array isn't ordered I would have to iterate through and check every single name until I found the right one. So how does the computer know where to find the information? Why can't it just include that functionality in arrays?</p>

					<h3>Hash Functions</h3>
					<p>Hashes, you might be interested to know, are essentially stored in arrays. Hashes use something called hash functions to turn a given string/symbol/variable into an integer. Some of these get very complicated, but a basic one works pretty much like the % function, it converts the given string to a value and then gets the remainder of that value divide by the size of the array that the hash is stored in. For (bad/cartoonish example), say that when I give my name the hash function returns the value 26. The array size is 20 so it stores the value associated with my name key at array index 6 (since 26%20 = 6).</p>

						<h6>a hash function diagram from Wikepedia</h6>
					</figure>
					
					<p>A hash function's purpose is to essentially convert keys into array indices. This is difficult because keys can come in all different sorts of lengths and values and there's only a limited space to store them in. It is possible, for example, that if you put your name through the hash function, it would return 6, in which case both of our names would want to be stored at index 6. The hash data structure has to have a way to quickly handle all these sorts of issues. I'm not clear enough on Ruby's implementation, but hashes can get complicated and there are all sorts of trade-offs between memory usage and clashes of these sorts.</p>

					<h2>In Conclusion...</h2>
					<p>...when you think about whether to use an array or a hash, you want to think about how you need to access your information. If your information is going to be sequential, your best bet is likely to use an array. If your information is going to be more scattershot, all over the place or have a lot of unique values, the hash is probably a better idea.</p>
