#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that borders can be really helpful in figuring out the difference and effects of changing the padding and margins. My code uses div.containers, much like the bootstrap stuff on codecademy, and I basically spent the whole time having those borders be red. There were lots of little things this helped with, for example: when width is set to 100%, does the padding add to that total or is it included? It turns out it adds to the total, and a margin will displace the div, but keep its width 100% of the parent element.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?

Based on my wireframe, the two big challenges I found with positioning were: the header in my site index and positioning the grouped sections in my blog/index. 

For the site index, it took me a while to get the title satisfactorily on the bottome line of my header image. I originally measured out the pixels and used the margins to place it, but that didn't feel right and I didn't think would be as easy to make responsive, so I switched to absolute positioning.

On my blog/index.html, I have groups of previews for blog posts with an image, a header and some text. I wanted, in particular, to have the header next to the phot over the paragraph of text. That required knowing the difference between inline-blocks and blocks. My nav bar also gave me some trouble.

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

Apart from just figuring out CSS, I really tried to focus on organizing the code and not repeating myself. I worked on all 3 of my html pages using 1 CSS sheet, and I found that to be mostly useful. I also tried to keep all my colors at the top of my site because I have seen some CSS sheets on sites I've visited group elements by their attribute rather than listing off every description under the tag. For instance, you have a bunch of different selectors to one pair of brackets, and those can be all the elements that are blue. Then if you want to change the color, you only have to go to one place or just move the tag. I really like this idea, but I had a had time figuring out where to put everything, when to make something a class vs id and also how to differentiate the CSS to work for multiple html files.

In terms of CSS ideas, positioning is still really tough for me. I think I need to get better at researching and reading documentation vs just trying a million different things. I kind of understand the difference between static and relative positioning, but I really don't feel comfortable explaining it, it's sort of situational knowledge which isnt great.




(Overall I spent too much time on this excercise, I spent about 5 1/2 hours. That was essentialy 4 1/2 and I had 2 of the pages good enough so I thought I could get the third real quick and I spent an hour on it. I really enjoyed every minute of it! Though I still don't feel great about not following instructions. I totally undertsand how this can be an epic time-suck!)
