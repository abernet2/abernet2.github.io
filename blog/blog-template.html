How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	The wireframing was kind of awkward to do cooperative because it was remote and on different sites. Our ides for our blogs were very different, so we did our own wireframes. The creation of the HTML pair I thought actually went well. I had a little more experience than my partner, so I had to explain quite a bit to him, and in the process I think it helped me understand my tendencies and also the point of holding off from doing the CSS.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	One of the reflections I wrote that I really hated the wire-framing and found it tedious, but it's really growing on me. It's a way to imagine different sites without spending a lot of time coding. So as long as I'm working on autonomous projects I definitely will, somewhere down the line that might change.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
	One that communicated your intention well. So we talked about our priorities about what we wanted to present to the world, and Micheal's was very clearly that he wanted to show his technical skills. In line with that, he gave his github name the highest priority of header.

	For me, I realized I needed to more clearly define my intentions because I couldn't really explain my wireframe choices.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
	I tried to use semantic elements, I think I put in a redundant div around nav. I wasn't sure if nave automatically displayed my links like a list. I also felt like I understood the point of the semantic elements, but I had trouble explaining why we need them, so I'm going to look into those again.
