        What are the benefits of version control?
    </h3>
    <p> 
        Controlling versions helps to foster collaboration and maintain clean, progressive versions of your code. The basic idea is that you save versions of your code to a big bucket called a repository. There you can manage what are the best feautures, most productive and best functioning bits and more. All of that happens by managing and merging versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you use version control, you make it easier to make big changes because going back becomes easy and reliable. You also allow a large group of people to work in parallel with minimal human work to cipher through conflicts and overlaps. You can also update your code with changes other people have made without losing your own code.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?
    </h3>
    <p> 
        Git helps you keep track of changes by giving you control over versions of your code. That may sound vague, but Git has a feauture called branches. Branches are sort of like when you save a file as file_v1 or file_v2, only better because Git is good and merging and updating files.
    </p>
    <p>
        With branches each person editing a slice of code can make their own branch. At first this might seem like a parallel timeline: each person writes completely independent pieces of code. In practice, Git makes it easy to incorporate into your local code the changes made to the master code. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time you save to a branch in Git, you commit a version of your code to that branch. Git compares that commit to previous commits. Since all branches originate from the master, if you keep updating your code to the master, it becomes very easy for Git to compare your code against the slightly different code that came before it.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Using Github is a good idea because it makes collaboration easy. It also helps keep your code accessible because it's online and can be found from any computer. Github allows you to see what you've done, which can be nice if you need to remind yourself to pat yourself on the back or if want to revert to something you've already done.
