# Hello Everyone

Here is my introductory blog post. I really like the idea of blogging about what I've been working on, at the very least to keep a record of what I've been doing. Hopefully the blog can help others learn as well!

> Anyway, I need to write a couple of paragraphs to test the styling on, so here it goes!

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert("Here's a code block");
```
