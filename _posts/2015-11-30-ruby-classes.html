title: Ruby Classes
excerpt: Classes are basically blueprints for ruby objects. Classes can be useful to store and manipulate data in a consistent and predictable way. In this example, I create a class to consistently manipulate data about the sides of Quadrilaterals to figure out what kind of Quadrilateral they are.

            Classes are basically blueprints for ruby objects. Classes can be useful to store and manipulate data in a consistent and predictable way. In this example, I create a class to consistently manipulate data about the sides of Quadrilaterals to figure out what kind of Quadrilateral they are.</p>
            <p>To begin, real quick, here's an overview of the class I made. We're going to refactor this for better use of instance/local variables, but for now here's a straightforward approach:</p>
<pre class=prettyprint>

class Quadrilateral

   def initialize(side1, side2, side3, side4, right_angle=false)
      @s1 = side1
      @s2 = side2
      @s3 = side3
      @s4 = side4
      @ra = right_angle
   end

   def parrellelogram?
         @s1 == @s3 && @s2 == @s4
   end

   def rhombus?
      @s2 == @s3 && parrellelogram?
   end

   def kite?
      @s1 == @s2 && @s3 == @s4
   end

   def rectangle?
      @ra && parrellelogram?
   end

   def square?
      @ra && rhombus?
   end

end
               </pre>

            <p>Basically what this object does is take in four sides, in consecutive order, and figures out which subset of a quadrangle it could be. It needs to remember the lengths of these sides so it can compare them later, which is why we create member variables for each.</p>
            <p>The upside of using local variables is that you if you perform some computation with them upfront, you can save on space and time later. With this specific class, you can see that there is some overlap between our methods and we have a quite a few repetitive method calls.</p>
            <p>Below I created a new method that makes better use of local variables by not saving the sides:</p>
            <pre class=prettyprint>

class Quadrilateral
   
   attr_reader :parrellelogram, :kite

   def initialize(side1, side2, side3, side4, right_angle=false)
      @parrellelogram = side1 == side3 && side2 == side4
      @kite = side1 == side2 && side3 == side4
      @ra = right_angle
   end

   def rhombus
      @kite && @parrellelogram
   end

   def rectangle
      @ra && @parrellelogram
   end

   def square
      @ra && rhombus
   end

end
            </pre>

            <p>What this does is computes all the important compares upfront and remembers the result, rather than remembering the sides and repeatedly computing them. This not only saves on memory, since now we only have 3 vs 5 variables, but it should also save on time and is a shorter amount of code.</p>
            <p>The downside to this approach, however, is that it could prove problematic in the future. For instance, what if I wanted to create a method that returns the perimeter or area of a particular quadrilateral? In that situation, it might be best to go with the original approach. Or what if we want to resize our quadrilateral or morph it into another quadrilateral?</p>
            <p>These questions bring out the important distinction between these variables. Local variables get forgotten pretty quickly, which can be mighty useful. The art of choosing between these two is the art of lettting that which truly does not matter slide. That art requires understanding how this class will be used and what changes might need to be made in the future.</p>
